            <h2>Formation</h2>
            <p>The origins of Avenged Sevenfold can be traced back to 1998 in Huntington Beach, California, when Jimmy
                Sullivan, a young drummer of only seventeen years old, left the band Suburban Legends, determined to
                form his own. Not long after, Jimmy pitched his idea to three friends from high school and proposed that
                they start a new band.</p>

            <div class="musical-style col-7">
            <h2>Musical Style</h2>
            <p>The band has been categorized under several genres of heavy and extreme music, primarily heavy metal,
                alternative metal, hard rock, and progressive metal with their earlier albums being categorized as
                metalcore. Avenged Sevenfold's musical style has consistently evolved throughout the duration of the
                band's career . Initially, the band's debut album Sounding the Seventh Trumpet consisted almost entirely
                of a metalcore sound.On Waking the Fallen,the band displayed a metalcore style once more, but added more 
                clean singing and leaned a bit more towards metal and bit less close to hardcore.</p>

            <div class="fame col-7">
            <h2>Fame</h2>
            <p>After finishing their tour on the Vans Warped Tour in 2004, the band released City of Evil, their third
                studio album, which was released on June 7, 2005 and debuted at #30 on the Billboard 200, selling more
                than of 30,000 copies in its launch week. Followed by the success of his new single, "Bat Country",
                which along with its video clip, sales skyrocketed and became his first gold record.</p>
                <br>
            <p>The sudden success of City of Evil led to their headlining at Ozzfest in 2006, along with bands like
                DragonForce, Lacuna Coil, Hatebreed, Disturbed and System of a Down.</p>

            <div class="name-emblem col-7">
            <h2>Name and emblem</h2>
            <p>The name of the group means "avenged seven times" and refers to Genesis, chapter 4, verse 15: "Cain said
                to God: 'Great is my punishment to bear! Behold, you are driving me off the face of the earth today, and
                I will hide myself from your presence. I will be a wanderer and a fugitive on Earth, and it will happen
                that whoever finds me will kill me. God answered him: â€œIt will not be so. Anyone who kills Cain will be
                avenged seven times. Then God put a mark on Cain, so that whoever found him would not kill him."
                The band uses an emblem known as the "Deathbat". It was originally designed by an artist friend of the
                high school band, Micah Montague. It is first seen on the album Sounding the seventh trumpet. Deathbat
                has been featured on all of the band's album covers, many of which were designed by CamRackam, a close
                friend of the band.</p>
