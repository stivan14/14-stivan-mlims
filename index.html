                <p>Avenged Sevenfold (often abbreviated as A7X) is an American heavy metal band from Huntington Beach,
                    California, founded in 1999.
                    Avenged Sevenfold began as a metalcore band with their debut album Sounding the Seventh Trumpet in
                    2001
                    and later with their
                    second album Waking The Fallen from 2003, in which The Rev and M. Shadows used the screaming vocal
                    style
                    on many songs on this album.
                    The band is mainly known for the versatility of their musical styles, their dramatic covers on each
                    of
                    their albums, and their logo: Deathbat.</p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    After the release of their third studio album and 2005's first hit City of Evil, Avenged Sevenfold
                    gradually morphed into a cleaner, non-yelling genre.
                    Later they released the DVD All Excess that tells the story of the band from its formation until
                    2007.
                    In July 2010 they released their fifth studio
                    album titled Nightmare which debuted at #1 on the Billboard 200 chart. This was the last album of
                    the
                    band with founder The Rev, as their vocal recordings were included, while their drum demos were
                    essentially played by Mike Portnoy.
                    <br>
                    On April 11, 2011, the band won Best Live Group at the Revolver Golden Gods festival On August 26,
                    2013
                    they released Hail to the King which marked the debut of drummer Arin Ilejay and also the band's
                    second
                    consecutive achievement to reach the top spot on the Billboard 200 chart.
                    The Stage is the seventh studio album by the American heavy metal band, Avenged Sevenfold. The album
                    was
                    released on October 28, 2016 in the United States, under the Capitol Records record label.
                    To date Avenged Sevenfold have sold more than 8 million records worldwide.
